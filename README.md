# Multiple Disease Prediction System

## Introduction
The *Multiple Disease Prediction System* is a comprehensive machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of various diseases, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and diabetes. This project leverages Python and machine learning libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and NumPy to develop models that can assist in early diagnosis and treatment planning for these diseases. Early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes, and this system aims to provide a reliable tool for preliminary disease screening.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- *data/*: Contains datasets for breast cancer, lung cancer, and diabetes.
- *models/*: Stores the trained machine learning models.
- *notebooks/*: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- *src/*: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- *README.md*: Documentation file with project details.
- *requirements.txt*: Lists required Python libraries.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

Install all the dependencies using:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Datasets
The project uses the following datasets:

1. *Breast Cancer Dataset*: Contains data on breast cancer diagnosis, including features like mean radius, mean texture, and diagnosis (benign or malignant).
2. *Lung Cancer Dataset*: Includes attributes related to lung cancer diagnosis such as age, smoking history, and tumor characteristics.
3. *Diabetes Dataset*: Contains features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and the outcome (diabetic or not).

## Data Preprocessing
Each dataset undergoes the following preprocessing steps:

1. *Handling Missing Values*: Imputation or removal of missing values.
2. *Feature Scaling*: Standardization or normalization of feature values.
3. *Encoding Categorical Variables*: Conversion of categorical variables into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding.

## Model Training
The following models are trained for each disease prediction:

- *Logistic Regression*: Used for binary classification tasks such as predicting the presence or absence of a disease.
- *Support Vector Machine (SVM)*: Effective for high-dimensional spaces and used for predicting outcomes based on features.
- *Random Forest*: An ensemble model that improves prediction accuracy by averaging multiple decision trees.
- *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*: Used for classification based on the proximity of feature values to the training data points.

## Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using metrics such as:

- *Accuracy*: The percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
- *Precision*: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
- *Recall*: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class.
- *F1 Score*: The weighted average of Precision and Recall, providing a balance between the two.

## How to Use
1. *Clone the Repository*:
    bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    
2. *Navigate to the Project Directory*:
    bash
    cd multiple-disease-prediction
    
3. *Run the Jupyter Notebook*:
    Open notebooks/Multiple_Disease_Prediction.ipynb to view the step-by-step implementation or use the Python scripts in the src/ directory for standalone predictions.

## Results
The models show promising results with high accuracy for each disease:

- *Breast Cancer Prediction*: 95% accuracy using Logistic Regression.
- *Lung Cancer Prediction*: 92% accuracy using Random Forest.
- *Diabetes Prediction*: 89% accuracy using SVM.

These results indicate that the system can be a valuable tool for initial screening, though further clinical evaluation is necessary.

## Future Work
- *Integration with a Web Interface*: Develop a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.
- *Model Improvement*: Experiment with advanced algorithms like deep learning to enhance model accuracy.
- *Additional Diseases*: Extend the system to predict other diseases such as heart disease or Alzheimer's.
